# Z-Fractal

Hello!

This is a program I wrote to render fractals generated from iterating Meromorphic functions on the complex plane, such as the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), the [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set), and the [Newton Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal).

While the code has been written, I have not yet decided to publish the code. You will probably have to wait about a day before I publish it. I want to make a few more renders, write up some documentation, and clean up / finalize my code.

Check back in 24 hours :)
